# Data-Structures_DeckOfCards
In this Python project, I created a program that lets the user create a hand from up to 53 playing cards. The user can specify the number of cards in the deck, and whether or not jokers should be included. The deck has the following methods: shuffle, deal, and show_status (display how many cards are left in the deck). See .docx file for more project details
